# Rocket request-id

This library provides a unique ID for a [rocket](https://rocket.rs/) request.

## Usage

Please see the minimal [example](examples/example.rs) or the documentation.

Or, better yet, don't use it! This isn't really a good idea it turns out.

## Crates.io?

This crate is not published on crates.io because it's not currently in use by our projects and, in fact, if you do need a unique request ID, it's likely a better idea to work with the rocket project to get it upstream.
